Borden Gym houses two full-size courts used for basketball, volleyball and a variety of other activities. The gyms also serve as the scene for high-energy pep rallies preceding Andover/Exeter athletic contests. In addition to the basketball courts, Borden Gym houses a swimming pool, eight squash courts, two dance studios, an indoor track, and a fitness center. The athletic program at Phillips Academy provides students with an array of intramural, instructional, and lifetime exercise options in addition to a stellar interscholastic program. These offerings do not exist apart from the PA academic experience but are an essential part of a holistic approach to education that encompasses the intellectual, emotional, physical, social and spiritual elements of each student.
