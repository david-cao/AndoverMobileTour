The Gelb Science Center, which opened in 2004, provides Andover students with the classrooms and facilities needed to enhance their study of everything from biology and astronomy to chemistry and quantum mechanics. Gelb is a state-of-the-art science center with fully equipped laboratories that make it possible for students to conduct hands-on work in science. Each floor is designed to accommodate a specific scientific discipline. Students perform lab exercises in biology, chemistry, and physics that are informative, fun, and can be applied to world issues. On the roof of the building sits the science centerâ€™s crown jewel, the Gelb Observatory, which houses a powerful, computer-controlled Classical Cassegrain Telescope used to study the heavens.
