The Memorial Bell Tower, which stands as a welcoming beacon to campus visitors, was built in 1923 as a memorial to the many graduates and faculty members who died in World War I. Thanks to its renovation in 2006, its bells, which were silenced in 1989, continue to chime throughout the day on the hour and the half hour and to mark special occasions.
