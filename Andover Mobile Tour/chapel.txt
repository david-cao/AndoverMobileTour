Built in 1932, the chapel was a gift from Thomas Cochran, class of 1890.  Besides serving as a place of worship for multiple faiths, the Chapel is home to the Philosophy and Religious Studies department and the Office of Community Service. It also is used for music practices and performances, religious services, and special speaking engagements. Since it is the one place on campus that can accommodate the full student body, it is also where students and faculty gather every Wednesday morning for All School Meeting. These ASMs are often used as an opportunity to bring in outside speakers and performers who can enrich Andoverâ€™s intellectual and cultural life.
