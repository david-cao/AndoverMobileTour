Boarding students live in single-sex dorms with house counselors and their families.  There are 52 dorms on campus, the largest of which houses 40 students and the smallest of which houses just four.  Thirty-five dorms house fewer than 20 students. Students live primarily in single and double rooms. Juniors, our youngest students, live in 9th-grade-only dorms. Older students live in dorms with students of mixed class years. For many students, dormitory life is one of the most valuable aspects of their time at Andover. Whether they are planning a pancake breakfast or studying for a history mid-term, students find that sharing life with people from very different backgrounds and from around the world is a rewarding learning experience. All dorms belong to one of five different “residential clusters.” These clusters function as small neighborhoods, giving students a strong sense of community.
