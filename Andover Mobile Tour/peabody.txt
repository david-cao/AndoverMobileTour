The Peabody Museum is one of the nation's major repositories of Native American archaeological collections. Major collections include materials from the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Southwest, Mexico, and the Arctic, and range from Paleoindian (10,000+ years ago) to the present day. The Peabody functions primarily as a teaching museum, making it an invaluable resource to PA students. Peabody staff members work closely with Andover teachers to create interdisciplinary courses that, among other things, explore interactions and relationships between the social sciences (human behavior) and the natural sciences (the physical world).
