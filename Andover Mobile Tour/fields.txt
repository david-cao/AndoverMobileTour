Andover has a number of athletic fields spread throughout the campus, but in this area you will find Phelps Stadium, the Sorota Track Complex, the majority of the schoolâ€™s 19 all weather tennis courts, and an area of campus affectionately known as Siberia. Siberia is a collection of practice fields that stretches out for several hundred yards behind Phelps Stadium and the Ice Arena.  Varsity soccer games are played on the natural grass field surrounded by the Sorota track. Varsity football, field hockey and lacrosse games are played in the stadium.
