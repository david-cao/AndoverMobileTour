Built in 1930 and renovated in the spring of 2009, Paresky Commons is the dining facility for the entire community. The building has four dining halls and two serveries—one upstairs and one downstairs. Among the amenities offered at Paresky are a full salad bar, a sandwich bar, an open hearth pizza oven, Panini presses, waffle makers, and frozen yogurt machines. A choice of entrees are available at each meal, and care is taken to meet the needs of students with varying dietary needs. The student den, Susie’s, is located in the basement level of Paresky. Here students can grab snacks throughout the day or relax and socialize. On weekends, Susie’s is often used for dances and other activities. Fun Fact: The Flagstaff Courtyard in front of Paresky was prominently featured in a scene in the movie, The Social Network. Can you guess which scene?
