Samuel Phillips Hall, Andover’s most iconic building, sits at the heart of the PA campus, surrounded by dorms and academic buildings. Built in 1924 and named after the school's founder, it houses both the History and World Languages departments as well as a state-of-the-art Language Learning Center (LLC). The LLC provides students with access to digital tools that greatly enhance the language learning process. Among other things, students can record and listen to their own voices, and take virtual tours of other countries. Be sure to stand on the top of the steps of Sam Phil and look outwards. This view, known as The Vista, stretches out across the school’s Great Lawn and extends for miles out into Western Massachusetts.
