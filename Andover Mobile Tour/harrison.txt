Opened in February 2002, the Harrison Rink is the home of Andover hockey. This state-of-the-art facility sports two sheets of iceâ€”the Harrison Rink (200' x 94'), which is the main arena with seating for 400, and the smaller but NHL-sized South Rink (200' x 85'). It also includes locker rooms for all four PA hockey teams and visiting squads, an athletic training room, spacious lobby and viewing areas, and locker space for teams using the nearby Phelps Stadium during the fall and spring seasons. The facility is utilized year-round for Andover teams, hockey camps, town youth hockey, and ice skating.
