Phillips Academy is fortunate to be the only secondary school in the country with a world-class art museum located right on campus. It not only gives students free access to one of the most comprehensive collections of American art in the world, but its newly built Museum Learning Center makes it a valuable educational resource for students in a wide range of classes. The museum has more than 17,000 objects in its permanent collection, spanning the 18th century to the present. The collection includes works by such artists as Winslow Homer, James McNeill Whistler, Edward Hopper, Georgia Oâ€™Keeffe, Frank Stella, and Jackson Pollock. In a typical year, the Addison presents approximately twelve shows, including both permanent collection installations and major traveling exhibitions.
