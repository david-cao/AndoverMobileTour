Graves Hall, constructed in 1883, is the home of the music department.  Students come to Graves for music courses, private lessons for virtually any instrument, and selected ensemble rehearsals. There are even 19 private practice studios. Graves houses the Clift Library, which is home to thousands of musical tracks, and also contains numerous workstations, which students use to analyze music and compose their own arrangements. It also contains the Timken Room, which is frequently used as a concert hall and recording facility. Senior recitals, chamber music performances, and band rehearsals all occur in Timken.
