Bulfinch Hall, built in 1818, is one of the oldest buildings on campus, making it an important link to Andover’s storied history.  Home of the English department, the building was completely renovated in 2012. In addition to the beautifully refurbished classrooms, Bulfinch now sports an expansive multimedia room that can be used for large gatherings and elaborate presentations. Many of the rooms are outfitted with handmade conference tables made from the pin oak trees cut down on site to make room for the building’s expansion. See if you can find the 2012 penny that the carpenter embedded in different spots on each table! On average, each class at Andover serves 13 students, allowing them to develop close working and personal relationships with their classmates as well as their teachers.
