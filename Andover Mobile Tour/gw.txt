George Washington Hall, or  "GW," is the main administrative building on campus. It’s the home of the Head of School’s office as well as such other important offices as the Registrar, College Counseling, Dean of Students, Dean of Studies, and Summer Opportunities offices. GW is also the home of the 400-seat Tang Theatre, used to stage dramas, musicals, and dance productions throughout the year. The student mailroom is located in the basement of GW. Here students can collect mail and packages from the full service post office, access an ATM machine, or socialize in the student lounge area. Lockers for day students are also located here. The building was named to commemorate the 1789 visit to campus by the country’s first president as part of his inaugural tour of the eastern states. His grand-nephew graduated from PA in 1803.
